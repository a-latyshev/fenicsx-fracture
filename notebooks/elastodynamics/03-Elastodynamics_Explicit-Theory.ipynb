    "In an explicit time integrator, the independent unknown of the system at an instant $t_{i+1}$ (typically $\\ddot{\\underline{u}}$) is entirely determined through the propagation of the known system's state at a previous instant $t_i$. According to this, Newmark's $\\beta$-Method becomes an explicit time integrator for the elastodynamics problem whenever the dissipative power $\\mathcal{Q}$ and $\\beta$ are both null. The latter choice is often accompanied by setting $\\gamma = 1/2$, leading to the so-called \"Central difference method\". Subsequently, Newmark's approximation of the displacement and velocity propagations to the instant $t_{i+1}$ particularizes as follows:\n",
