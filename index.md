# Computational fracture mechanics examples with fenicsx

This webpage provides basic examples on computational methods to solve fracture mechanics problems using [DOLFINx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/).

This work includes the contribution of the Early Stage Researchers (ESR) of the ITN project [Newfrac](https://www.newfrac.eu) funded by the European Commission under a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Grant Agreement n. 861061.

DOLFINx documentation can be found on the website or on the excellent [Dolfinx Tutorial](https://jsdokken.com/dolfinx-tutorial/) by Jørgen Schartum Dokken.

The webpage is build using Jupyter-book, reusing the configuration of the [Dolfinx Tutorial](https://jsdokken.com/dolfinx-tutorial/).

Comments and corrections to this webpage should be submitted to the issue tracker by going to the relevant page, then click the ![git](git.png)-symbol in the top right corner and "open issue".

## Usage

See the file [README.md](README.md) for how to use docker image or install dependencies with conda.

### Interactive tutorials

As this book has been published as a Jupyter Book, we provide interactive notebooks that can be run in the browser. To start such a notebook click the ![Binder symbol](binder.png)-symbol in the top right corner of the relevant tutorial.

## Credits

This project is created using the open source [Jupyter Book project](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the book of [dolfinx-tutorial](https://github.com/jorgensd/dolfinx-tutorial/blob/dokken/jupyterbook/Dockerfile) as a template.
