    "The above image shows image shows the *deformed configuration* of an initially straight silicone beam with cylindrical cross-section under its own weight. This material is very soft and quite dense. The resulting rotations and strains are large, so the assumptions made in a geometrically linear elastic model are no longer valid. For sensible predictions we must use the theory of finite elasticity. Source: Mazier et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13455\n",
